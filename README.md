# dmwikimap

This is the home for the little web application used to view / edit _dungeon master_ maps. It's located at https://dmwiki.atomas.com/maps/view/Conflux/0/

It is a part of the Dungeon-Master Wiki: https://dmwiki.atomas.com/
Some features relies on some Wiki pages to provide map annotations and level description.

It is a project written in php / mysql / javascript in 2007, so it uses very old librairies (Prototype.js !). But it still works in 2021 !
